**Some things you might want to know**
<ul>
  <li>1992 Born in Hefei / 2019 Graduated from Peking University / Lives in Beijing</li>
  <li>I'm currently doing some research on living at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
  A not-so-long list of my research results (<i>focus is the last thing I can do</i>) can be found on <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wFTQeXwAAAAJ&hl=en'>Google Scholar</a> and <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tianbai_Xiao'>ResearchGate</a>.</li>
  <li>I play applied and computational math. I create pieces that solve the problems there. Often the problems are themselves caused by other pieces, which were also created by me. It's fair to say I know very little about anything.</li>
  <li>I'm an enthusiast of Tchaikovsky and Debussy. Sometimes I do photography. I benefited a lot from the work of Hiroshi Sugimoto and Yoshihiko Ueda. I'm addicted to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Juan_(author)'>Li Juan</a> lately.</li>
  <li>Studying and working in Europe (mostly Germany) changed me forever, but the more I realize that I am a pure oriental from bones.</li>
</ul>

**Things I've been interested in lately**
<ul>
  <li>Different languages as different worlds</li>
  <li>The ultimate between man, machine, and computing power</li>
  <li>Taking pictures with Sh≈çji Ueda's mindset</li>
  <li>Why China produces cybersecurity experts</li>
  <li>Microeconomics as a many-agent system</li>
</ul>
